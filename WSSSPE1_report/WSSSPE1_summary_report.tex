\section{Introduction}

The First Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Practice and Experiences (WSSSPE1, \url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/WSSSPE1}) was held on Sunday, 17 November 2013, in conjunction with the 2013 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC13, \url{http://sc13.supercomputing.org}).

Because progress in scientific research is dependent on the quality and accessibility
of software at all levels, it is now critical to address many challenges related to the
development, deployment, and maintenance of reusable software. In addition, it is
essential that scientists, researchers, and students are able to learn and adopt
software-related skills and methodologies. Established researchers are already
acquiring some of these skills, and in particular a specialized class of software
developers is emerging in academic environments who are an integral and embedded
part of successful research teams. The WSSSPE workshop was intended to provide a
forum for discussion of the challenges, including both positions and experiences.
The short papers and discussion have been archived to provide a basis for continued
discussion, and the workshop has fed into the collaborative writing of this journal publication.
Additional papers based on extended versions of workshop submissions are expected.
The level of interest in the workshop has led the organizers, working with some of the submitters
and some of the attendees, to plan two additional workshops (at the 2014 SciPy and SC conferences) and to turn
the workshop website into a community website that can be used as a focus for further
discussion and progress.

Before the WSSSPE1 workshop took place, the organizers self-published a paper~\cite{WSSSPE1-pre-report} to document the process of organizing and advertising the workshop, collecting and reviewing the papers, and putting together the agenda.  Section~\ref{sec:process} is based on that paper.  The remainder of this paper is based on the workshop itself, as documented in a set of collaborative notes taken during the workshop~\cite{WSSSPE1-google-notes}, including discussion about the keynote presentations (\S\ref{sec:keynotes}), the three panels (\S\ref{sec:devel}-\ref{sec:community}), other discussion (\S\ref{sec:other}), cross-cutting issues (\S\ref{sec:cross-cutting}), use cases (\S\ref{sec:use-cases}), and conclusions (\S\ref{sec:conclusions}).

\todo{Mention a two-session minisymposium on ``Reliable Computational Science'' in the SIAM Annual Meeting in July. It aims to further explore some of the key issues raised in WSSSPE. Speakers include Tim Davis, Barry Smith, Lorena Barba, Tanu Malik, Bill Rider.}

\section{Workshop Process and Agenda} \label{sec:process}

WSSSPE1 was organized in collaboration of the relatively small group of five organizers and
a larger peer-review committee with 36 members. This committee had early influence on the organization,
e.g., on the specific call for papers.

The workshop call for papers included:

\begin{quote}
In practice, scientific software activities are part of an ecosystem where key roles are held by 
developers, users, and funders. All three groups supply resources to the ecosystem, as well as 
requirements that bound it. Roughly following the example of NSF's Vision and Strategy for Software 
(\url{http://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf12113})~\cite{NSF_software_vision}, 
the ecosystem may be viewed as having challenges related to:

\begin{itemize}
\item the development process that leads to new (versions of) software
\begin{itemize}
\item how fundamental research in computer science or science/engineering domains is turned  into reusable software
\item software created as a by-product of research
\item impact of computer science research on the development of scientific software
\end{itemize}
\item the support and maintenance of existing software, including software engineering
\begin{itemize}
\item governance, business, and sustainability models
\item the role of community software repositories, their operation and sustainability
\end{itemize}
\item the role of open source communities or industry
\item use of the software
\begin{itemize}
\item growing communities
\item reproducibility, transparency needs that may be unique to science
\end{itemize}
\item policy issues, such as
\begin{itemize}
\item measuring usage and impact
\item software credit, attribution, incentive, and reward
\item career paths for developers and institutional roles
\item issues related to multiple organizations and multiple countries, such as intellectual property, licensing, etc.
\item mechanisms and venues for publishing software, and the role of publishers
\end{itemize}
\item education and training
\end{itemize}

\end{quote}

Based on the goal of encouraging a wide range of submissions from those involved in software practice, ranging from initial thoughts and partial studies to mature deployments, the organizers wanted to make submission as easy as possible. The call for papers stated:

\begin{quote}
We invite short (4-page) position/experience reports that will be used to organize panel and 
discussion sessions. These papers will be archived by a third-party service, and provided DOIs. We 
encourage submitters to license their papers under a Creative Commons license that encourages 
sharing and remixing, as we will combine ideas (with attribution) into the outcomes of the workshop. 
An interactive site will be created to link these papers and the workshop discussion, with options for 
later comments and contributions. Contributions will be peer-reviewed for relevance and originality 
before the links are added to the workshop site; contributions will also be used to determine 
discussion topics and panelists. We will also plan one or more papers to be collaboratively 
developed by the contributors, based on the panels and discussions.
\end{quote}

58 submissions were received, and almost all submitters used either 
arXiv~\cite{arXiv-web} or 
figshare~\cite{figshare-web} to self-publish their papers. 

A peer review process followed the submissions, where the 58 papers received 181 reviews, an 
average of 3.12 reviews per paper. Reviews were completed using a Google form, which allowed 
reviewers to provide scores on relevance and comments to the organizers and to the authors. The review reports enabled the organizers to decide which papers to associate with the workshop, and the authors to improve their papers.

The organizers decided to list 54 of the papers as significantly contributing to the workshop, a very 
high acceptance rate, but one that is reasonable, given the goal of broad participation and the fact 
that the reports were already self-published. The papers were also grouped into three main categories, namely \emph{Developing and Supporting Software}, \emph{Policy}, and \emph{Communities}. Each subject area was associated with a panel and discussion at the workshop.

The workshop itself consisted of two keynote presentations and the three panels/discussion sessions. The panels 
were organized based on a classification of the workshop submissions into three categories, following 
the themes of the call for papers as modified by the areas of the submissions. Three to four representatives from 
each submission category were appointed as panelists, and assigned to read a subset of the paper in that category and then discuss them in the panel.


\section{Keynotes} \label{sec:keynotes}

The WSSSPE1 workshop began with two keynote presentations.

\todo{section should include what was presented and what was discussed}

\todo{change references to papers or presentations to cites}

\subsection{A recipe for sustainable software, Philip E. Bourne.}

The first keynote\footnote{\url{http://wssspe.researchcomputing.org.uk/keynotes/\#bourne}}
was delivered by Philip E. Bourne of UCSD. The slides
are online.\footnote{\url{www.slideshare.net/pebourne/a-recipe-for-sustainable-software}}

Philip is a basic biomedical scientist but has formed four software
companies. He also helped found PLOS and PDB\footnote{\url{http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do}}.

He emphasized that Sustainability for software ``does not just mean more
money from Government.''

He noted that creating effective illustrations is a key function of
software in the biomedical sciences: ``Automating Conceptualization''
(Visualizing molecular structures is a problem that has now been solved,
he is working on 3-d visualizations of the contents of cells.)

He has looked into reproducibility in computational biology, and has
concluded that ``I have proved I cannot reproduce research from my own
lab''~\cite{Veretnik}.

He noted that in places, development in science has improved thanks to
open source and Github, but for the most part remains arcane. He argues
that there is a lot we can learn from the app-store model. He
mentioned BioJava\footnote{\url{http://biojava.org/wiki/Main_Page}} and
OpenScienceDataCloud\footnote{\url{https://www.opensciencedatacloud.org/}} as
distribution channels.

He noted a common evolutionary pathway for computational biology
projects, from data archive to analytics platform to educational use. He
suggests that use for outreach might be the final step.

He experienced problems with staff retention with respect to private organizations which reward 
those combining research and software expertise (the ``Google Bus''). However,
he is a strong fan of private sector sustainability sources and PPP\note{what does PPP mean?}. He
noted that making a successful business from scientific software alone
is very rare: founders overvalue while customers undervalue. He noted
that to last, an open source project needs a minimal funding requirement
even with a vibrant community -- good will only goes so far if you are
being paid to do something else.

He talked about grant schemes of relevance in the U.S., particularly with regard to technology transfer.\footnote{\url{http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappguide/nsf09_1/gpg_2.jsp\#IID2}} \footnote{\url{http://www.nsf.gov/eng/iip/sbir/}}

He had problems with selling research software: the technology transfer
office in his university wanted huge IP reachthrough, whereby they would get a
share of profits from drugs developed by pharma companies who use the
software. He was aware this was unrealistic but the technology transfer
office insisted for a
while. He wants to push a one-click approach to purchasing
university-written software. 

He then presented the usual arguments on directly valuing software as a
research output alongside papers. Readers will be familiar with this
debate. An interesting reference here is ``What
does peer review mean when applied to computer code?, Rosemary Dickin.''
\footnote{\url{http://blogs.plos.org/biologue/2013/08/08/what-does-peer-review-mean-when-applied-to-computer-code/}}

He then expanded on the idea of the \textbf{digital enterprise}, where
IT underpins the whole of organizational activities. He contends that
universities are way behind the curve on this. In particular, he
highlights the separation of research, teaching and administration into
silos without a common IT framework as a blocker to many useful
organizational innovations: ``University 2.0 is yet to happen.'' He
spoke of a circumstance where someone had used an algorithm developed
for computational biology in marketing.

The role of an institution is important in this space. He argued that
funders can help train institutions not just individuals.

He concluded with a reference to his paper~\cite{bourne_ten} and argued that computational scientists ``have a
responsibility to convince their institutions and communities that
software is scholarship,'' a point with which we strongly agree.

\subsection{Scientific Software and the Open Collaborative Web, Arfon Smith}


The second keynote\footnote{\url{http://is.gd/wssspe}} was by
 Arfon Smith\footnote{\url{http://arfon.org/}} of Github.

His talk used an example from data reduction in Astronomy, where he
needed to remove interfering effects from the device. He built a
``bad pixel mask'', and realized that while this is persistent, there
was no way/practice of sharing this with the data, so many researchers
repeated the same calculations. He estimated that 13 person-years were wasted in
this redundant calculation.

He asked, of this practice, ``why didn't we know better?'' and argued
this was because we were taught to focus on immediate research outcomes
and not on continuously improving and building on tools for research. He
then asked, later in our working lives, when we do know better, why
don't we act any different, and argued this was due to incentives and their lack:
only the immediate products of research, not the software, are valued.
He referenced Victoria Stodden's talk at OKCon\footnote{\url{http://okcon.org/main-speakers/victoria-stodden/}},\footnote{\url{http://www.stanford.edu/~vcs/talks/OKcon2013-Sept172013-STODDEN.pdf}}
which he said argued these points well.

He cited the EMCEE\footnote{\url{https://github.com/dfm/emcee}} Markov Chain
Monte Carlo code by Dan Forman Mackey\footnote{\url{http://dan.iel.fm/}} and Joe Zuntz\footnote{\url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/~zuntz/Joe_Zuntz/Welcome.html}} as 
good examples of  scientific projects using GitHub.  

C. Titus Brown\footnote{\url{http://ged.msu.edu/}} argues that with regard to
reusable software, ``we should just start doing it.'' Arfon noted that
documentation should be ``treated as a first class entity.''
He noted that some software fields have excellent cultures of module
reuse, such as rubygems\footnote{\url{http://rubygems.org/}},
PyPI\footnote{\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi}}, and CPAN\footnote{\url{http://www.cpan.org/}}, where there is effectively
ultra-low-friction collaboration through these repositories. This has
not happened in highly numerical, compiled language scientific software.

He argued that the GitHub Pull Request code review mechanism facilitates
such collaboration, by allowing one to code first, and seek review and a
merge back into the trunk later.

Fernando Perez says that ``Open Source
is reproducible by necessity'' - since reproducibility is a prerequisite
for remote collaboration.
Arfon therefore defined GitHub as part of the next stage in development
of the web, following on from the ``social web'' of Facebook et.al.:
``The Collaborative Web.''

\subsection{What are communities?}
\subsection{Challenges of community}
include metrics for community success (e.g., more external contributors than internal).
\subsection{Admirable scientific software communities}
\begin{itemize}
\item example communities
\item their (quick) origin stories.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Resources for learning about software communities}
\begin{itemize}
\item academic fields studying communities (and software communities)
\item courses on online communities
\item books
\item need for software carpentry module on organizing communities?
\end{itemize}

\section{Other Discussion} \label{sec:other}

\note{from the misc questions/answers/observations part of the google doc?}

\section{Cross-cutting Issues}  \label{sec:cross-cutting}


\subsection{Defining sustainability}

\subsection{Licensing}

\note{not sure if this was really cross-cutting...}


\section{Illustrative Use Cases} \label{sec:use-cases}


Perhaps discuss sustained software use-cases and issues surrounding them. Some examples could be mvapich, Galaxy, Swift, Cactus, etc.

\note{Dan: do we need this section?  I think there's some overlap between this and the discussion in the Developing and Support Software section.  Or perhaps this should go in the cross-cutting issues section?}

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}


\todo{pull the discussion together}

\todo{add some analysis of the deficiencies and difficulties that are present in different fields, and those that are common?}

\subsection{Recommendations or Lessons}

\note{if needed.}

\subsection{Follow up actions}

\note{or at least the discussion about them, and the current plans for future events.}

\note{conclusions from pre-workshop paper follows}

The WSSSPE workshop has begun an experiment in how we can collaboratively build a workshop 
agenda. However, contributors also want to get credit for their participation in the process. And the 
workshop organizers want to make sure that the workshop content and their efforts are recorded. 
Ideally, there would be a service that would be able to index the contributions to the workshop, 
serving the authors, the organizers, and the larger community. But since there isn't such a service 
today, the workshop organizers are writing this initial report and making use of arXiv as a partial 
solution to provide a record of the workshop.

After the workshop, one or more additional papers will be created that will include the discussions at 
the workshop. These papers will likely have many authors, and may be submitted to peer-reviewed 
journals.
